Book Recommender System is designed for my personal learning using a Kaggle-sourced dataset. It utilizes Python and data-processing techniques to analyze user preferences and suggest relevant books. The dataset includes basic details such as Title, Author, Image, etc., but books cannot be opened or accessed beyond their listed information. The system enhances book discovery by offering insightful recommendations tailored to reading habits.
